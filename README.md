# Car-Sales-Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard created using Tableau Public Edition. The dashboard visualizes car sales data from January 2020 to December 2021, offering rich insights into performance metrics such as sales trends, customer preferences, and regional distribution. Designed with interactive filters and visual storytelling in mind, the dashboard enables users to dynamically explore the data based on transmission type, engine type, body style, gender, and date range.

The dashboard highlights essential KPIs including Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, which reached $371.19 million with a Year-over-Year (YoY) growth of 23.59%. The YTD Average Price stands at $27.99K, showing a slight decline of 0.79%, and the total number of cars sold is 13.26K, marking a healthy 24.57% YoY growth. A weekly sales trend line chart captures fluctuations over time, peaking around week 48 with $15.53M in weekly sales.

In terms of visual insights, the dashboard includes a body style analysis using a pie chart, revealing that SUVs dominate the market with $99.89M in sales, followed by Hatchbacks, Sedans, Hardtops, and Passenger vehicles. A donut chart for sales by car color shows that Pale White cars are the most preferred, generating $174.53M, followed by Black and Red. Regional analysis highlights that cities like Austin, Janesville, and Scottsdale have the highest sales, and a bar chart compares manual vs. automatic transmission preferences in these locations.

The dashboard also includes a company-wise sales comparison table, showing metrics such as number of cars sold, average price, total sales, and contribution to total YTD revenue. Chevrolet leads with over 25K cars sold and a 7.30% contribution, followed by Ford and Dodge.
